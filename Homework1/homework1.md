# Homework1 - Final Project
/*This is my plan*/

### Idea

The website I plan to create for my final project is a movie creation website
almost like vine or snapchat stories.

### Outline of Functions

1. Main Page
*  a. Will display a sign up option, search option, about option, and the video
  with the most likes of the previous day

2. User page
*   a. Users will have their own page which will feature their work and allow them and only them to edit their files.  The videos they create will be displayed on their page as well as the search page.

3. Search page
*   a. You can browse and view other small movies that are made based on their search tags 

4. Files
*   a. Each movie will only be allowed to be a few min long and can be pieces of
  video tied together.  We will only allow for videos.  

5. Users will be able to:
*   a. make an account
**      i. create movies
*   b. search for movies
*   c. like or dislike a movie

### Research

I have started to look at ruby gems which might be able to help me with creation
of this website.  [Carrierwave] provides video conversion to HTML5 friendly
format.  I also might want to use and include a few other feature which I'm
still debating like adding a friends section or a group to collaborate on making
a video on a group page and having everyone provide to their project.  I think
the main idea I have going into this is to provide a website where the user can
create a video.  I may have to look into [Javascript] and other rails features.
